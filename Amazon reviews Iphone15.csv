Even with iOS 17.1.1 the phone heats up while using (surprisingly not much while charging through MagSafe Charger).Fantastic camera setup, though a 5X zoom is missed.

I switched over to 15 Pro Max. Thanks to the less weight due to titanium body.

"R2CWSBZ2ONJM1W","Sahil Qureshi","I recently got into Apple system with a purchase of iPad Air 5. Looking at the my usage, iPad fit well with my overall system so I decided to switch to iPhone from OnePlus 7 after 4 years of usage.I have to say that iPhone does have a premium feel to it, not only in appearance but in performance and UI too. Switching and transferring data and WhatsApp are fairly simple now with Move to IOS app. After setting up my phone in a day, it was ready for daily use without keeping my Android along as a secondary device.Big worry before buying 15 pro was reported overheating issues but Apple has fixed that problem with iOS 17.0.3 and I haven‚Äôt encountered heating issues after initial setup process.I will get straight to pros and cons below:Pros:1. ProMotion: You can feel 120hz vs 60hz right away.2. Camera: Point and shoot without hassle. But one needs to check out few YouTube tutorials to understand Camera app settings thoroughly.3. Customisation: Yes this sounds strange but Shortcuts app on iOS is so powerful. You can do many system level customisation with shortcuts and automation.4. Battery life: With medium usage, I get through whole day. Stats for nerds: it averages above 4.2 min per 1% discharge and gives me 7+ hrs of estimated SOT. Estimated here because I don‚Äôt use full 0-100% charge and discharge cycles.5. Performance and Security: No further description should be required.6. 80% Charge limit: This setting helps when I keep my phone plugged in to car for CarPlay because it stops overcharging to 100%.7. Weight: I haven‚Äôt myself experienced difference in in-hand feel of 15 Pro vs previous generation Pro models but my colleagues and friends who own Pro model of previous generations notice the difference in weight first hand.Cons:1. Apple keyboard takes some typing to get used to.2. Notifications could be a mess if you like having notification from all apps enabled. I keep most of mine turned off so no biggie for me.3. Simple tasks as custom ringtone, streaming music to car through Bluetooth needs work around or hacks you find on YouTube.","Reviewed in India on 12 November 2023","Best Phone at this price range (Pun intended)","4.0 out of 5 stars","","22","Natural Titanium","256 GB",

"R2XR624G4WV0RP","AVI deOry","Just got the hands on this new iP15Pro and well at the first glance it looks so classy but not as premium as old stainless steel models. Although bc of titanium body its now v light weight so kindda win win situation for me atleast. I have been using iP14PM from past 1 year now and had to say no significant difference i can notice in speed, camera and all. So final verdict If you are using old iP‚Äôs such as X,11,12 series then sure go ahead for iP15P/M but if you are using iP13,14 series then nahh dont upgrade not worth it at all. Also no heating issues I can feel in iP15Pro till now.
